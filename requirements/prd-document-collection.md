## Document Information
- **Document Title**: Document Collection PRD
- **Version**: 1.0

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Document Collection feature, which aims to to provide tools, model context protocol (MCP) server, and processes for efficiently collecting and managing design documents for architectural reviews and assessments.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Goals
1. **Goal 1**: Provide tools to retrieve documents from the user's local workstation
1. **Goal 1**: Provide tools to retrieve documents from the web pages over http
2. **Goal 2**: Convert documents to a standardized markdown format for analysis
3. **Goal 3**: Support document in a variety of formats including:
   - PDF, 
   - PowerPoint,
   - Excel,
   - Word, and 
   - Markdown

## 4. Target Users and Personas

### 4.1 Primary Users
These utilities are intended to be used as tools and MCP servers by Github Copilot Chat users.

Personas:
1. **Architect**: Responsible for designing the system architecture and ensuring it meets business requirements.
2. **Agent**: A Github Copilot Agent that interacts with the Architect to collect and assess design documents.

#### Use Case 1: Local Document Retrieval
- **Actor**: Architect
- **Preconditions**: The user has access to the MCP server and the necessary tools installed.
- **Steps**: 
  1. The Architect initiates a Architectural reviews.
  2. The Agent requests from the Architect the design documents to be collected.
  3. The Agent retrieves the documents from the specified sources.
  4. The Agent processes the documents and converts them to markdown format.
  5. The Agent stored them in a designated location for further analysis.
- **Expected Outcome**: Document are successfully collected, converted, and stored for review.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Must Have (P0)
**Critical features that must be included in the initial release.**
1. **Requirement 1**: Create a tool to retrieve documents from the user's local workstation
   - **Inputs**: 
     - File path or URL of the document
     - Destination path for saving the document with a defult path of `./documents`
   - **Processing Steps**:
     1. Retrieve the document from the specified location on the user's local workstation.
     2. Convert the document to markdown format.
     3. Save the reformatted document to the specified location.
   - **Outputs**: 
     - The reformatted document is saved in the specified location
     - The document is converted to markdown format for analysis
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - The tool is invoked as a command via 
       - an MCP server
       - directly from the command line
       - as a make target
     - The tool must successfully retrieve documents from the user's local workstation
     - The tool must convert documents to markdown format without data loss
     - The tool must save the reformatted documents in the specified location

## 8. Technical Considerations

### 8.1 Architecture Overview
**High-level technical architecture approach.**

### 8.2 Technology Stack
   - **Technologies and frameworks to be used.**
     - Python 3.15 or later
     - uv for package management
     - Pydantic for data validation
     - requests for HTTP requests
     - mypy for type checking
     - ruff for code formatting
     - pytest for testing
     - make for automation
     - structlog for logging
     - rich for enhanced command-line output


### 8.3 Other Considerations
   - **Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive unit test coverage for all components. Maintain at least a minmum of 80% code coverage.
