# Structured Architecture Review Process Prompt

## Prompt
Please conduct a structured architectural review following these phases:

### Phase 1: Document Analysis
First, I'll analyze the provided design document to understand:
- Architecture type and scope
- Key components and their interactions
- Technology choices and patterns used
- Business objectives and constraints

### Phase 2: Reference Identification
Let me identify relevant references for comparison:
- Industry best practices and patterns
- Applicable standards (TOGAF, ISO, etc.)
- Technology-specific guidelines
- Security and compliance frameworks

### Phase 3: Preliminary Assessment
I'll compare your design against these references to identify:
- Alignments with best practices
- Deviations and their justifications
- Initial strengths and concerns
- Areas requiring clarification

### Phase 4: Clarifying Questions
Before finalizing my review, I need to understand:

**Architecture Decisions:**
- [Questions about specific design choices]
- [Rationale for key decisions]
- [Alternative approaches considered]

**Requirements & Constraints:**
- [Questions about non-functional requirements]
- [Budget or timeline constraints]
- [Integration requirements]

**Risk & Mitigation:**
- [Questions about identified risks]
- [Mitigation strategies]
- [Contingency plans]

### Phase 5: Your Input
Please provide answers to the questions above so I can complete a comprehensive review.

### Phase 6: Final Review
Based on your responses, I'll provide:
- Updated assessment incorporating your clarifications
- Specific recommendations with rationale
- Risk analysis with mitigation strategies
- Prioritized improvement suggestions
